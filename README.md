  Recursion and Iteration
i) In recursion, a function has the ability to call itself until the base condition is reached.

On the other hand iteration is a process of repetition until the condition fails. 

ii) Iterative approach involves four steps, initialization , condition, execution and  updation.

In recursive function only base condition (terminate condition) is specified.

iii) Recursion keeps your code shorter and a tad bit simpler.

 Whereas iteration may tend to make your code longer.

iv) Recursion is slower than iteration due to overhead of maintaining stack whereas iteration is faster.

v) Recursion takes more memory than iteration due to overhead of maintaining the stack.
